mediawiki
is
a
free
and
opensource
wiki
engine
it
was
developed
for
use
on
wikipedia
in
and
given
the
name
mediawiki
in
it
remains
in
use
on
wikipedia
and
almost
all
other
wikimedia
sites
including
wiktionary
wikimedia
commons
and
wikidata
these
sites
continue
to
define
a
large
part
of
the
requirement

for

mediawiki
was
originally
developed
by

the

optimized
to

large
projects
which
can
have
terabytes
of
content
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of

one
of
the
worlds
largest
websites
achieving
scalability
through
multiple
layers
of

and
database

has
been
a
major
concern
for

another
major
aspect
of

is
its
its

the

history
when
wikipedia
was
first
launched
in
january
it
ran
on
the
existing
wiki
software
usemodwiki
which
is
written
in
perl
and
stores
all
wiki
pages
in
text
files
this
software
soon
proved
limiting
both
in
its
and
its
performance
in
mid
magnus
manske
a
developer
and
student
at
the
university
of
cologne
who
was
also
a
wikipedia
editor
began
working
on
new
software
that
would
replace
usemodwiki
specifically
for
use
by
wikipedia
this
software
was
written
in
php
and
stored
all
its
information
in
a
mysql
database
it
launched
on
the
english
wikipedia
in
january
and
was
gradually
deployed
on
all
the
wikipedia
language
sites
of
that
time
this
software
was
referred
to
as
the
php
script
and
as
phase
ii
with
the
name
phase
i
given
to
the
use
of
usage
soon
caused
load
problems
again
and
soon
afterward
another
rewrite
of
the
software
began
done
by
lee
daniel
crocker
which
was
first
known
as
phase
iii
this
new
software
was
also
written
in
php
with
a
mysql
backend
and
kept
the
basic
interface
of
the
phase
ii
software
but
was
meant
to
be
more
scalable
it
went
live
on
wikipedia
in
july
the
wikimedia
foundation
was
announced
on
june
and
in
july
wikipedia
contributor
daniel
mayer
suggested
the
name
mediawiki
for
the
software
as
a
play
on
wikimedia
the
name
was
gradually
phased
in
beginning
in
august
the
name
has
frequently
caused
confusion
due
to
its
intentional
similarity
to
the
wikimedia
name
which
itself
is
similar

one
of
the
earliest
differences
between
mediawiki
and
its
predecessor
usemodwiki
and
other
wiki
engines
was
the
use
of
free
links
instead
of
camelcase
when
mediawiki
was
created
it
was
typical
for
wikis
to
require
text
like
worldwideweb
to
create
a
link
to
a
page
about
the
world
wide
web
links
in
mediawiki
on
the
other
hand
are
created
by
surrounding
words
with
double
square
brackets
and
any
spaces
between
them
are
left
intact
eg
world
wide
web
this
change
was
logical
for
the
purpose
of
creating
an
encyclopedia
where
accuracy
in
titles
is
uses
an
extensible
lightweight
wiki
markup
designed
to
be
easier
to
use
and
learn
than
html
tools
exist
for
converting
content
such
as
tables
between
mediawiki
markup
and
html
efforts
have
been
made
to
create
a
mediawiki
markup
spec
but
a
consensus
seems
to
have
been
reached
that
wikicode
requires
grammar
rules
the
following
sidebyside

the
differences
between

tools
have
been
described
as
somewhat
challenging
to
learn
a
survey
of
students
assigned
to
use
a
wiki
found
that
when
they
were
asked
an
open
question
about
main
problems
with
the
wiki
cited
technical
problems
with
formatting
eg
couldnt
figure
out
how
to
get
an

in
cant
figure
out
how
to
show
a

make
editing
long
pages
easier
mediawiki
allows
the
editing
of
a
subsection
of
a
page
as
identified
by
its
header
a
registered
user
can
also
indicate
whether
or
not
an
edit
is
minor
correcting
spelling
grammar
or
punctuation
are
examples
of
minor
edits
whereas
adding
paragraphs
of
new
text
is
an
example
of
a
nonminor
while
one
user
is
editing
a
second
user
saves
an
edit
to
the
same
part
of
the
page
then
when
the
first
user
attempts
to
save
the
page
an
edit
conflict
occurs
the
second
user
is
then
given
an
opportunity
to
merge
his
content

application
programming
interface
mediawiki
has
an
extensible
web
api
application
programming
interface
that
provides
direct
highlevel
access
to
the
data
contained
in
the
mediawiki
databases
client
programs
can
use
the
api
to
log
in
get
data
and
post
changes
the
api
supports
thin
webbased
javascript
clients
and
enduser
applications
such
as
tools
the
api
can
be
accessed
by
the
backend
of
another
web
site
an
extensive
python
bot
library
pywikibot
and
a
popular
tool
called
also
interface
with
the
api
the
api
is
accessed
via
urls
such
as
in
this
case
the
query
would
be
asking
wikipedia
for
information
relating
to
the
last
edits
to
the
site
one
of
the
perceived
advantages
of
the
api
is
its
language
independence
it
listens
for
http
connections
from
clients
and
can
send
a
response
in
a
variety
of
formats
such
as
xml
serialized
php
or
json
client
code
has
been
developed
to
provide
layers
of
abstraction
to

rich

mediawiki
supports
rich
content
generated
through
specialized
syntax
for
example
the
software
comes
with
optional
support
for
rendering
mathematical
formulas
using
latex
and
a
special
parser
written
in
ocaml
similar
for
other
content
ranging
from
graphical
timelines
over
mathematical
plotting
and
musical
scores
to
egyptian
hieroglyphs
is
available
via
software
has
become
more
powerful
at
dealing
with
a
wide
variety
of
uploaded
media
files
its
richest
is
in
the
area
of
images
where
image
galleries
and
thumbnails
can
be
generated
with
relative
ease
there
is
also
support
for
exif
metadata
the
use
of
mediawiki
to
operate
the
wikimedia
commons
one
of
the
largest
free
content
media
archives
has
driven
the
need
for
further

this
areabecause

such

one
of
wikipedias
earliest
problems
had
been
the
separation

under
the

a

describe
the

be

chooses
this

more
commonly
each

fact
that

part
of
the

the
format
of
these

has
been
cited
as
a
strength
by
one
educator
who
stated
that
it
provides
more
finegrain
capabilities
for
discussion
than
traditional
threaded
discussion
forums
for
example
instead
of
replying
to
an
entire

the
participant
in
a

can
create
a
hyperlink
to
a
new
wiki
page
on
any
word
from
the
original
page
discussions
are
easier
to
follow
since
the
content
is
available
via
hyperlinked
wiki
page
rather
than
a
series
of
reply
messages
on
a
traditional
threaded
discussion
forum
however
except
in
few
cases
students
were
not
using
this
capability
possibly
because
of
their
familiarity
with
the
traditional
linear
discussion
style

a
lack
